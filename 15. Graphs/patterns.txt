1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Topological Sort
- Directed Acyclic Graph.
- if u -> v, then u should appear before v.
- DFS: push nodes into stack while backtrack. pop all nodes and return.
4. Kahn's Algorithm (Topo Sort using BFS)
- find indegree of all nodes.
- push node with indegree 0 into queue.
- reduce indegree of adjacent nodes. If indegree becomes 0 push into queue.
5. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- does not work for negative weight cycle.
- single source shortest path.
- can be solved using priority queue (min heap), set, queue.
- time complexity E log V.
